# Babel Plugin Flow Runtime

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/amilajack/babel-plugin-flow-runtime.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

**This is a fork of the original [babel-plugin-flow-runtime](https://github.com/codemix/babel-plugin-flow-runtime). This fork fixes https://github.com/codemix/flow-runtime/issues/149**

## Installation

This plugin has a runtime dependency on [flow-runtime](https://github.com/codemix/flow-runtime/tree/master/packages/flow-runtime), so make sure you install that along with this package:

```sh
npm install --save-dev github:amilajack/babel-plugin-flow-runtime
npm install --save flow-runtime
```
